# WHO-DIA
This repository contains the source files for the Diet Impact Assessment (DIA) model. The DIA model was commissioned by WHO Europe and developed by Marco Springmann. 

How to access and use the DIA model is described in its manual of use which is available in the repository and at: https://www.who.int/europe/publications/i/item/WHO-EURO-2023-8349-48121-71370

The DIA model was written in General Algebraic Modeling Language (GAMS) making use of the Model Interface with Rapid Orchestration (GAMS MIRO). It can be run with a free demo licence, provided it's used for non-commercial purposes, available at: https://www.gams.com/products/gams/gams-language/.
